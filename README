BoxDodge is a very quickly put-together browser-based HTML5 orientated project to learn, sharpen, enhance, and understand how these new technologies work.

Just fire up ./index.html inside your browser and play.
The box in the middle is yours, click to begin. The box will follow your cursor, don't let it touch anything else including the surrounding walls.
